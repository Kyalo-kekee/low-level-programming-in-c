# gcc preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. 

When you compile a C program using the GCC compiler, the process involves several stages: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking. Each of these stages performs a specific task and produces an intermediate output that is used as input for the next stage. Here is a brief overview of these stages:

1. Preprocessing: The preprocessing stage is the first stage of the compilation process. In this stage, the preprocessor reads the source code and performs various preprocessing operations such as macro expansion, conditional compilation, and file inclusion. The preprocessed code is output to a temporary file with a ".i" extension.

2. Compilation: In the compilation stage, the preprocessed code is compiled into assembly language code. This assembly code is platform-specific and represents a low-level representation of the program's functionality. The resulting assembly code is output to a temporary file with a ".s" extension.

3. Assembly: The assembly stage is where the assembly code is assembled into machine code. This is done by the assembler, which converts the assembly code into binary machine code that the computer can execute. The resulting machine code is output to a temporary file with a ".o" extension.

4. Linking: The linking stage is the final stage of the compilation process. In this stage, the linker links together all the object files created during the assembly stage to create a single executable file. The linker resolves external references and performs various other tasks, such as adding startup and shutdown code. The resulting executable file is typically named after the program, with no file extension.

Each of these stages is an important part of the compilation process and contributes to the final executable file. Understanding how each stage works can help you diagnose and fix issues in your C program, and can also help you optimize your code for performance.
